# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis--Task-4
Part 1: Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset
In this part, we load the Twitter sentiment analysis dataset and preprocess it by renaming the columns for clarity and removing redundant columns. We then display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.

Part 2: Analyzing Sentiment Distribution
In this part, we analyze the overall sentiment distribution of the tweets. We use a bar plot to visualize the frequency of each sentiment category, which helps us understand the general sentiment trends in the dataset.

Part 3: Analyzing Sentiment Distribution Across Different Entities
In this part, we analyze how sentiment is distributed across different entities (topics/brands). We use a stacked bar plot to visualize the sentiment distribution for each entity, providing insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
